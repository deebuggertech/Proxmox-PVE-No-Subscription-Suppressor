# Proxmox PVE No-Subscription Suppressor

Tired of Proxmox nagging you about not having a subscription?  
This little Firefox add-on politely tells it to calm down.

### What it does
- Removes the **"No valid subscription"** popup.
- Leaves you in peace.

### Disclaimer
I really appreciate the effort behind Proxmox! It’s awesome that there’s a free variant available. This add-on just hides the “No valid subscription” popup, but it doesn’t magically give you a subscription. You’re still using the free version, and you should be aware of those trade-offs.
